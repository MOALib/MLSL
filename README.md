# LibMLSL

A logging library for C++.

A very simple API, single header and C++ 98 compatible and also compiles with clang. To try it out, run "make", it will build a utility in C++ 98 (Bit broken as you need to have content inside the file for it to work, but the utility does this for you) and make a documentation.
